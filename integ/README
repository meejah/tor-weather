Integration Tests
=================

This is a start of a py.test-driven suite of Selenium tests that
exercise a development instance of Tor Weather via https://weather.dev

Run Them
--------

Once pytest and selenium are installed ("pip install pytest selenium"
or "apt-get install python-pytest python-selenium" [FIXME reall?]):

cd integ
py.test
